# BakingApp
Part of Udacity's Android Nanodegree<br /><br /><br />


Create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.<br />
In this project, I created an app to view video recipes. <br />
I handled media loading, verified user interfaces with UI tests, and integrated third party libraries.<br />
Also, I provided a complete user experience with a home screen widget.<br /><br /><br />


In this project:<br /><br />

• Used a MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.<br />
• Handled error cases in Android.<br />
• Added a widget to the app experience.<br />
• Leveraged a third-party library.<br />
• Used Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones as well as tablets.<br />
